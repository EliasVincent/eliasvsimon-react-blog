# eliasvsimon blog

This is the eliasvsimon.com website, now it's a blog-style Dynamic React App.
It will use some elements and design things from the good-ole classic eliasvsimon.com though, and some things from a failed React attempt back in March of this year.

### Credits

Significant parts of this React App are from willjw3's series on a React Blog Home Page with Markdown. [visit his website}(https://developer-log.netlify.app/)
