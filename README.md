# eliasvsimon blog

This is the eliasvsimon.com website, now it's a blog-style Dynamic React App.
It will use some elements and design things from the good-ole classic eliasvsimon.com though, and some things from a failed React attempt back in March of this year.

## How to build

1. Clone this repo
2. Install NodeJS
3. Run `npm install` in root directory of repo

Now you can i.e. use the development server of create-react-app with `npm start`

### Credits

Significant parts of this React App are from willjw3's series on a React Blog Home Page with Markdown. [visit his website](https://developer-log.netlify.app/)

## Some notes

* run `npm run server` to make the json files for the posts and pages
* images are in the public/images folder, if you want to include images in the Mardown posts, use HTML: `<img src="/images/your-image.png">`
