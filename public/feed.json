If so, you might be interested in Vicunia!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/14.png\" title=\"Vicunia\" alt=\"Vicunia\">\r\n\r\nAlpaca.cpp is a project that allows you to run a fast ChatGPT-like model locally on your device. It combines the LLaMA foundation model with an open reproduction of Stanford Alpaca, a fine-tuning of the base model to act like ChatGPT and a set of modifications to llama.cpp to add a chat interface. Alpaca.cpp can run on Windows, Linux and macOS, and requires only 4GB of weights.\r\n\r\nWhat is Vicunia?\r\n\r\nVicunia is a frontend for using alpaca.cpp and providing a GUI for installing and chatting with Stanford Alpaca. It is built with React.js, Next.js and Nextron. Vicunia aims to make it easy download and use models like Alpaca, without having to deal with CLI tools or complicated setup steps, which is how most local machine learning things are right now. Vicunia also offers some features such as emoji support, options menu for all parameters and exporting your chat history.\r\n\r\n[Try it out here](https://github.com/EliasVincent/vicunia)\r\n\r\n",

Do you feel like YouTube's auto-subtitles suck?\r\n\r\nWhisper-Subtitles-WebUI is a gradio frontend for OpenAI Whisper that allows you to generate subtitles for videos. You can choose the output format of the subtitles, such as SRT or embedded into a new video file and download them.

The closest thing to it is Todoist but I found it to be slow and unintuitive on all my devices. MS-Todo has a website version, but I've never been a big fan of using websites for everything, since you always lose some native functionalities like alt-tab and launching it from the start-menu.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/7-3.png\" title=\"Natively integrated thanks to Electron's .deb build function\">\r\n\r\nI knew that you could make web-apps feel and behave like native applications with the Electron framework, so I just set up an Electron App to launch a window accessing the MS-Todo website. It was a bit tricky at first to find the right configuration for the metadata and the icons, but now I think it works quite well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/7-1.png\" title=\"Microsoft To-Do on Linux\">\r\n\r\nThere are some drawbacks to this approach however. Since it's an Electron App, it bundles the full Chromium and NodeJS in addition to just the few lines I've written, making the application well over 100MB large. And since I've hardcoded the URL to MS-Todo, if Microsoft ever changes the URL, the app will become useless.\r\n\r\nSo, if you're on Linux and still want to use Microsoft To-Do, there's an App for that now!\r\n\r\n[**Download on Github**](https://github.com/EliasVincent/ms-todo-electron-web-app)",
