Have you ever wanted to chat with a powerful language model on your own device, without relying on cloud services or internet connection? If so, you might be interested in Vicunia!

<img src="/images/14.png" title="Vicunia" alt="Vicunia">

Alpaca.cpp is a project that allows you to run a fast ChatGPT-like model locally on your device. It combines the LLaMA foundation model with an open reproduction of Stanford Alpaca, a fine-tuning of the base model to act like ChatGPT and a set of modifications to llama.cpp to add a chat interface. Alpaca.cpp can run on Windows, Linux and macOS, and requires only 4GB of weights.

What is Vicunia?

Vicunia is a frontend for using alpaca.cpp and providing a GUI for installing and chatting with Stanford Alpaca. It is built with React.js, Next.js and Nextron. Vicunia aims to make it easy download and use models like Alpaca, without having to deal with CLI tools or complicated setup steps, which is how most local machine learning things are right now. Vicunia also offers some features such as emoji support, options menu for all parameters and exporting your chat history.

Have you ever wanted to have transcribed or translated subtitles for a video? Do you feel like YouTube's auto-subtitles suck?

Whisper-Subtitles-WebUI is a gradio frontend for OpenAI Whisper that allows you to generate subtitles for videos. You can choose the output format of the subtitles, such as SRT or embedded into a new video file and download them. You can also translate the speech in the video from other languages to English, if you enable the translation option. It's all running locally on your own hardware.

<img src="/images/13.png" title="Whisper-Subtitles-WebUI" alt="Whisper-Subtitles-WebUI">

To use this, you need python and about 5GB+ of free space. [Your hardware dictates how large of a model you can run](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages).

Hello there again, haven't posted in a while here :D

I have done a bunch of things in the meantime, working on some projects and stuff but I haven't really "published" a project in almost a year. To get back in the swing I made a small game for the Ludum Dare 52 Gamejam.

<iframe src="https://itch.io/embed/1869264?bg_color=553700&amp;fg_color=ffffff&amp;link_color=fa5c5c&amp;border_color=444444" width="208" height="167" frameborder="0"><a href="https://riesyeti.itch.io/cat-crop-collector">Cat Crop Collector by Riesyeti</a></iframe>

Harvest weird crops while fending off foes with your anti-monster spray!

It was also a great opportunity to test out Godot 4, which is still in Beta right now.

In Elden Ring it's kinda hard to see how many runes each Great Rune in your inventory gives and how many you will get combined, so I made this handy little calculator.

[**Visit ano-books**](https://ano-books.herokuapp.com/)

Ano Books is a full stack web app where anyone can create, edit, and delete a "book". It's a very concering and fundamentally flawed concept for sure, but it's very fun too!

Instead of me explaining it here, [you should just check it out ;)](https://ano-books.herokuapp.com/)


Since this is more of a tech exercise than anything else, here's some of it

- React as frontend
- Express as backend
- Postgresql as database

<img src="/images/9-1.png" title="Ano Books">

I want to look into a search feature, a filter option and maybe some oauth thing to toggle visibility or something. But for now it's a grand free for all

[**Visit the repo**](https://github.com/EliasVincent/ano-books)

That's it for now, happy writing!

Catspace.xyz is my new site with various services that are available to anyone for free!
Right now, Catspace has

- [a Blog](https://blog.catspace.xyz)
- [a Git Server](https://git.catspace.xyz)
- [an Online Markdown Editor](https://md.catspace.xyz)
- and more to come!

I'm trying to do a federated social media thing like Mastodon or Pleroma. Let's if I get it working or if it even makes sense at all.

Expect services on Catspace to change rapidly, always look at the Blog to see what's available!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
I've tried out Linux throughout the last couple of weeks and while I've found a replacement for pretty much every Windows-exclusive software, Microsoft To-Do is just really good. The closest thing to it is Todoist but I found it to be slow and unintuitive on all my devices. MS-Todo has a website version, but I've never been a big fan of using websites for everything, since you always lose some native functionalities like alt-tab and launching it from the start-menu.

<img src="/images/7-3.png" title="Natively integrated thanks to Electron's .deb build function">

I knew that you could make web-apps feel and behave like native applications with the Electron framework, so I just set up an Electron App to launch a window accessing the MS-Todo website. It was a bit tricky at first to find the right configuration for the metadata and the icons, but now I think it works quite well.

<img src="/images/7-1.png" title="Microsoft To-Do on Linux">

There are some drawbacks to this approach however. Since it's an Electron App, it bundles the full Chromium and NodeJS in addition to just the few lines I've written, making the application well over 100MB large. And since I've hardcoded the URL to MS-Todo, if Microsoft ever changes the URL, the app will become useless.

So, if you're on Linux and still want to use Microsoft To-Do, there's an App for that now!

Me and SoulPixel participated in the [Godot Wild Jam #22](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-22). The theme of the jam was "Revolution", so we came up with an arcade-strategy game called Perestroika.

## The Game

You have to gather a crowd around you. Your followers will give you FAME. With your FAME you can acquire even more followers!

But be careful. The red people, they will try to throw you and your followers over!
Your followes can also slowly turn into red people, cheer them on from time to time.
Standing behind the red flag will give you a lot of FAME, but beware, they're a hot-spot for the red people!
How many followers can you gain before the time runs out?

## Play

I released Catformer, my first game ever. It's made with the Godot Game Engine. 

It's a 2D Platformer where you play as a ball-shaped cat and have to save the moon from losing all it's shine.

The game is, obviously, far from perfect and has a lot of issues.
