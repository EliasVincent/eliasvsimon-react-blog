Hello there again, haven't posted in a while here :D

I have done a bunch of things in the meantime, working on some projects and stuff but I haven't really "published" a project in almost a year. To get back in the swing I made a small game for the Ludum Dare 52 Gamejam.

Harvest weird crops while fending off foes with your anti-monster spray!

It was also a great opportunity to test out Godot 4, which is still in Beta right now.
