Have you ever wanted to have transcribed or translated subtitles for a video? Do you feel like YouTube's auto-subtitles suck?

Whisper-Subtitles-WebUI is a gradio frontend for OpenAI Whisper that allows you to generate subtitles for videos. You can choose the output format of the subtitles, such as SRT or embedded into a new video file and download them. You can also translate the speech in the video from other languages to English, if you enable the translation option. It's all running locally on your own hardware.

To use this, you need python and about 5GB+ of free space. [Your hardware dictates how large of a model you can run](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages).
