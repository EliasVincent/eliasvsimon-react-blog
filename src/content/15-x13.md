Me, [SoulPixelIV](https://twitter.com/SoulPixelIV), [ProtoKrok](https://twitter.com/ProtoKrok) and [DervlX](https://twitter.com/DervlX) made a game for the [Ludum Dare 54 Gamejam](https://ldjam.com).

Welcome to the unveiling of the successor to Machina-Machination’s popular X-12 manned indoor combat mech!

The X-13 is but a prototype, and is not yet proven for real-world use. This is where you come in.

As our best combat pilot, awarded with the medal of honor, you’ve been pulled out of retirement for one last mission. Investors will take a close look at your performance.

Give them a show to remember, this weapon might change the future of warfare.
