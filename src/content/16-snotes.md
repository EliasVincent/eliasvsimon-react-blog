On the side I've been working on **SNOTES**, a simple desktop note-taking application built with Tauri and SQLite. It's been a while since the last update and I wanted to show a bit of progress.

SNOTES is all about simplicity and speed. No bloat, no BS - just quickly create, paste, tag and search notes. It's built with Tauri as the frontend framework and uses SQLite as the storage backend, which means it's lightweight and blazing fast.

It's not the most complex thing from a software development standpoint: everything fits inside a ~1000 line vanilla TypeScript file, but it actually turned out to be quite useful to me.

Some highlights:

- **Free** - SNOTES is free software
- **Simple** - Create and manage your notes with a simple and intuitive interface
- **Fast** - Everything from startup to search is lightning fast
- **OCR** - Use Optical Character Recognition to extract text from image files
- **Export** - Export your notes in various formats such as TXT or Markdown

If you're tired of overcomplicated note apps and just want something that works, give SNOTES a try.
