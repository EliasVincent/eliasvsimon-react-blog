Me and SoulPixel participated in the [Godot Wild Jam #22](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-22). The theme of the jam was "Revolution", so we came up with an arcade-strategy game called Perestroika.

## The Game

You have to gather a crowd around you. Your followers will give you FAME. With your FAME you can acquire even more followers!

But be careful. The red people, they will try to throw you and your followers over!
Your followes can also slowly turn into red people, cheer them on from time to time.
Standing behind the red flag will give you a lot of FAME, but beware, they're a hot-spot for the red people!
How many followers can you gain before the time runs out?
