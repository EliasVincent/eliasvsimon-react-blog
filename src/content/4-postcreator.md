Hello there again

🕘🕝🕗Aaall the way back in February I've already tried to make a React website, but ultimately it failed due to lack of direction and upcoming school work. But in that project I had this idea, that visitors could create their own "boxes" in a form text field, and it would instantly turn into one of those weird stylized "boxes" I had in the old version of this website:

<img src="/images/image-post-4.png" title="yeah, that one was weird..">

***

Now, I've taken some of that and made a sort-of post-creator for this website 📑. [Scroll down the main homepage to access it or **click here.**](/) There you can input any text you want, it also supports Markdown syntax, since the text gets passed into a React-Markdown module.
