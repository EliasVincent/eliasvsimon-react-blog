Hello there, it's been a while.
Have you ever seen the game Gex64, that N64 game where the mascot just makes dated jokes and celebrity references all the time? Ever wished that there should be more such terrible gags? Now fear no more! With the **Gex Simulator under the "Apps" section**, you can have more terrible quotes that might as well could've been from the glorious Gex himself.

In case you don't know the masterpiece that is Gex64, watch some gameplay here. Like, all of it:

The link routing should hopefully play nice with Firebase now, and shouldn't throw an error anymore.
