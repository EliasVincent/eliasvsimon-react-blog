Catspace.xyz is my new site with various services that are available to anyone for free!
Right now, Catspace has

- [a Blog](https://blog.catspace.xyz)
- [a Git Server](https://git.catspace.xyz)
- [an Online Markdown Editor](https://md.catspace.xyz)
- and more to come!

I'm trying to do a federated social media thing like Mastodon or Pleroma. Let's if I get it working or if it even makes sense at all.

Expect services on Catspace to change rapidly, always look at the Blog to see what's available!
