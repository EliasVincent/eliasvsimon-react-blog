Mastodon is a "federated" social media platform, it's great! The short time I've spent with various people and communities around the "Fediverse" has been great and far more valuable and engaging to me than other, more restrictive services like Twitter. It's so great in fact that I've decided to create my very own instance on it.

Having your own instance has several benefits:
- It's your own platform. You decide what you can do and you can customize it to your liking
- Complete independence from any company, institution or other instance
- It's cool! I mean, who gets to say *I have my own social media platform* ?

Of course there are some drawbacks to this. It took me ages to set up properly, but learned many valuable lessons along the way on how to set up a relatively complex thing such as Mastodon. Right now the server runs on a rather inexpensive VPS, it works fine right now but I will watch the utilization and especially disk space usage very carefully.

Right now I'm discovering tons of great software and projects, so I will probably self host some other services too. I'm considering an additional, more broad Blog next to this one.

If you are a cool person and want to be part of the cat space, feel free to join!
