Ano Books is a full stack web app where anyone can create, edit, and delete a "book". It's a very concering and fundamentally flawed concept for sure, but it's very fun too!

Instead of me explaining it here, [you should just check it out ;)](https://ano-books.herokuapp.com/)


Since this is more of a tech exercise than anything else, here's some of it

- React as frontend
- Express as backend
- Postgresql as database

I want to look into a search feature, a filter option and maybe some oauth thing to toggle visibility or something. But for now it's a grand free for all

That's it for now, happy writing!
