Hi! I'm Elias and this is eliasvsimon.com, my personal website/blog.

I'm a software developer working in intralogistics software. Outside of that I'm developing mostly web apps and games in my free time. Check out the Apps and Games pages.

This site is a React App which turns Markdown files into pages. It's pretty cool.
