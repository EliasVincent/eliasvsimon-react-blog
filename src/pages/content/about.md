Hi! I'm Elias and this is eliasvsimon.com, my personal React website/blog

Currently I'm learning **programming with web-development and also game-development**, check out my games page.
Of course I still have *much* to learn, so this website will change a lot over time.

This site is a React App which turns Markdown files into pages. It's pretty cool.
